# StreamMe

This website was a personal project designed on Figma and whipped up using the MERN stack. It utilizes [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to make **get requests** which returns movie posters and info. 

It uses JWT Token for user AUTH and users are stored in MongoDB Atlas which contain an empty array where users can add the ID of the movie they enjoy which they can see on their user profile at any time.

## Built with
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The JavaScript framework used
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - For better state management
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Document-oriented database used for storing User schemas + Movie ID's
- [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) - Movie Database
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - Used for fetching data from TMDB API
- [SCSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) - CSS Pre-processor
